# Income Import — Implementation Notes

> **Scope.** This document is the deep-dive reference for the historical
> income import only. Everything cross-cutting (the single-file DuckDB
> model, `settings.accounting_currency` storage semantics, the unified
> `0001_initial_schema.sql` migration stream, FK-safe catalog sync,
> etc.) is owned by [architecture.md](architecture.md) and must be
> consulted first. If this file and `architecture.md` ever disagree,

## Schema

### `data/dinary.duckdb` — table `income`

```sql
CREATE TABLE income (
    year   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    month  INTEGER NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,          -- settings.accounting_currency (default EUR)
    PRIMARY KEY (year, month),
    CHECK (month BETWEEN 1 AND 12)
);
```

Defined in `src/dinary/migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql` alongside every
other ledger and catalog table — the per-year `budget_YYYY.duckdb` /
`config.duckdb` split was removed in the single-file reset, so there is
exactly one migration stream. `income.amount` is stored in the configured
accounting currency (default `"EUR"`, i.e. the value of
`settings.accounting_currency`); the column is dimensionless at the schema
level because the accounting-currency choice is a deployment-wide setting,
not a per-row attribute.

### `.deploy/import_sources.json` — operator-local source registry

```json
[
  {
    "year": 2022,
    "spreadsheet_id": "…",
    "worksheet_name": "Budget 2022",
    "layout_key": "rub_fallback",
    "income_worksheet_name": "Balance",
    "income_layout_key": "balance_rub_rsd"
  }
]
```

The per-year source registry used to live as an `import_sources`
DuckDB table; it now lives as a gitignored JSON file at
`.deploy/import_sources.json`, loaded by
`dinary.config.read_import_sources`. The file is OPTIONAL and only
consumed by `inv import-*` tasks. One record per year carries both
expense and income source metadata; the ``income_*`` fields are
absent or empty for years without a structured income worksheet
(e.g. 2012–2018). See the repo-root `imports/` directory for the
full schema and workflow documentation.

## Layouts

`IncomeLayout` dataclass in `src/dinary/imports/income_import.py` maps sheet columns:

| Layout key | col_date | col_amount | currency | transition |
|------------|----------|------------|----------|------------|
| `balance_rub` | 1 | 2 | RUB | — |
| `balance_rub_rsd` | 1 | 2 | RUB | month ≥ 8 → RSD |
| `balance_rsd` | 1 | 2 | RSD | — |
| `income_rsd` | 1 | 2 | RSD | — |

### Mid-year currency transition (2022)

2022 income was received in RUB through July, then in RSD from August.
`balance_rub_rsd` layout handles this: `transition_month=8`, `transition_currency="RSD"`.
The same column contains amounts in both currencies; the month determines which rate to apply.

## Year → source mapping

Registered in `.deploy/import_sources.json` (one entry per year with
an `income_worksheet_name` populated):

| Year | Worksheet | Layout |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 2019 | Balance | balance_rub |
| 2020 | Balance | balance_rub |
| 2021 | Balance | balance_rub |
| 2022 | Balance | balance_rub_rsd |
| 2023 | Balance | balance_rsd |
| 2024 | Income | income_rsd |
| 2025 | Income | income_rsd |
| 2026 | Income | income_rsd |

Years 2012–2018 have no income source — no structured income data in those sheets.

## Import flow (`import_year_income`)

1. Read `.deploy/import_sources.json` via `dinary.config.get_import_source(year)` → spreadsheet ID, worksheet, layout key.
2. Pre-fetch NBS middle rates for the 1st of each month for every currency
   the layout will need (source currency and the accounting currency).
   Rates are held as `RSD per 1 unit of X` so an identity entry (RSD
   itself, or the accounting currency when it is RSD) is just `Decimal(1)`.
   This runs inside a short-lived writer cursor so the subsequent sheet
   loop does not hold the DuckDB write slot across HTTP round-trips.
3. Open the Google Sheet via `gspread`, read all rows from the income
   worksheet.
4. For each row after `header_rows`:
   - Parse date → extract `(year, month)`. Skip rows where year ≠ target.
   - Parse amount (handles `$`, spaces, commas).
   - Determine currency (base or transition based on month).
   - Convert to the accounting currency via the pre-fetched rates
     (`amount * rate_src / rate_acc`). Missing rate → skip row with a
     warning.
5. Aggregate by month.
6. In a single DuckDB transaction: `DELETE FROM income WHERE year = ?`
   then insert one row per `(year, month)`.

## Verification (`verify_income_equivalence`)

Re-reads the sheet, re-aggregates in the accounting currency (EUR by
default), and compares month-by-month against DB with a ±0.02
tolerance. The result dict uses `total_sheet_acc`, `total_db_acc`,
and `accounting_currency`.

## Invoke tasks

All destructive income-import tasks require explicit `--yes` confirmation:

- `inv import-income --year=YYYY --yes` — destructive re-import of one year.
- `inv import-income-all --yes` — destructive re-import of every registered year (run as part of the coordinated reset flow).
- `inv verify-income-equivalence --year=YYYY` — verify one year against the source sheet (no `--yes` needed; read-only).

## Historical results (2026-04, EUR snapshot)

The table below is the import log at the time income was last fully
re-imported against the EUR accounting currency (the current default).
It should be re-checked with `inv verify-income-equivalence-all` after
any re-import, and after any change to `settings.accounting_currency`
(which would shift every stored row and invalidate these totals).

| Year | Months | Total EUR |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 2019 | 12 | 25,520.45 |
| 2020 | 12 | 30,616.14 |
| 2021 | 12 | 30,468.42 |
| 2022 | 12 | 60,722.47 |
| 2023 | 9 | 36,402.40 |
| 2024 | 10 | 43,237.91 |
| 2025 | 10 | 50,334.96 |
| 2026 | 3 | 15,158.71 |

All years passed zero-diff verification at the time of that snapshot.
